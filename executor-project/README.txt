Project Code: T4G02

== COMPILING AND RUNNING==
You can compile by typing "make all" on this directory. The
executable file "executor" goes to "bin".

== READING AND UNDERSTANDING THE CODE ==
You can easily read and understand our code by starting by 
the headers: Executor.h and Process.h. We use code comments
to indicate what we are doing in the most important places.
"Trivial" code and functions are more simple commented.

Our implementation is very simple and efficient, therefore, 
if you read the code with attention, you can easily understand 
what we did.

== FINAL CONSIDERATIONS==
As a standard, we correcty handle the program errors, the user input
and built an easy interface.
